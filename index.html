        <h3>Mahalaxmi Temple</h3>

        <h3>Rankala Lake</h3>
        Rankala Lake in Kolhapur is a serene freshwater lake formed from a stone quarry after a 9th-century earthquake.
It’s surrounded by lush gardens, the majestic Shalini Palace, and offers boating and horse riding for visitors.
The lake is steeped in legend—locals believe a submerged temple of Rankabhairav lies beneath its waters.
Evenings here are magical, with food stalls and a peaceful lakeside walkway drawing both tourists and locals.

        <h3>Panhala Fort</h3>
        Panhala Fort is the largest fort in the Deccan region, perched atop the Sahyadri hills about 20 km from Kolhapur.
It played a key role in Maratha history—Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj spent over 500 days here, and it was the site of the legendary escape to Vishalgad during the Battle of Pavan Khind.
The fort’s zigzag shape earned it the nickname “Fort of Snakes,” and its massive ramparts, hidden well (Andhar Bavadi), and granaries (Ambarkhana) still stand as testaments to its strategic brilliance.
Queen Tarabai, a powerful figure in Maratha history, ruled from here and shaped Kolhapur’s destiny during her regency.
